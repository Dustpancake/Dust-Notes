# Unit testing with Catch2! and Trompeloeil
I needed to unit test some arduino code I was working on, which required the use of a mocking framework. After reading online, I discovered that [trompeloeil](https://github.com/rollbear/trompeloeil) (working in conjunction with [Catch2!](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/)) was probably the best approach to this.

They are both header only libraries, favouring a 'no-default' approach to testing; in the words of Bjorn Fahller (developer of Trompeloeil): 
> I wanted to reduce the number of wtf moments.
