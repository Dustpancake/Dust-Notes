## Julia Notes
I have created a seperate repository [julia-notes](https://github.com/Dustpancake/julia-resources) where I will be documenting my exploration of the Julia language.

I will use this directory as a link and overview, with some special language features highlighted, and recipes included. 

As always, this repository is a work in progress.
